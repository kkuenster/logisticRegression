# wineQuality
I utilized a public dataset of Portuguese red wines and their rating (1-10) with KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and logistic regression, comparing the performance of each algorithm for predicting whether a particular wine is good quality (rating >=7), or bad quality (rating <7).

The dataset necessary for the code to compile is included in this repository. All other needed items are imported in the code.
